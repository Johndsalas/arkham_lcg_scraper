In addition to all of that, it lets you take an action *from* a turn where you have nothing important to do (because you wouldn't play this if you did), and move it *forward* to a turn when you need it (because you likely wouldn't use it unless you need it).  Is it a great card?  No.  But action manipulation could come in handy in certain builds.\n",

So it's got to be balanced as a card in and of itself and as part of a campaign level risk/reward and that seems like a tricky card to get right. Like, it's got to be able to do something in most decks, but not outclass the class-specific tarot cards or end up OP in the specific context of the Circle Undone. Given all that I'm not surprised it ended up a bit too small of an effect. :) But I wonder what a balanced neutral tarot would be? Something like the Red-Gloved Man, maybe?\n",

Sefina has the best odds for that. But for Survivors, who had the weakest tarot before the Return-box it was also a bearable risk, because they can avoid it being a dead card with Cornered or (in case of Wendy and Duke) their gator ability. They might also setup a \"Will to Survive\" combo with this card, likewise rogues a \"Payday\" combo. It's not a terrible card, but on the lower end of usability.\n",
